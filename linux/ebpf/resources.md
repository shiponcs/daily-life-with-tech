## Written and Videos:

1. [A thorough introduction to eBPF](https://lwn.net/Articles/740157/)
2. https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf/
3. [Understanding eBPF in a hurry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNTQ8CNv7A0): A talk by **Software Engineer Ray Jenkins** in LinkedIn Performance Engineering Meetup.  I would label this with "An Introduction to eBPF from Software Engineering Perspective".
4. [A beginer's guide to eBPF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrSExTfS-iQ): a short talk by Liz Rice
5. [eBPF superpower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SiWL5tULnQ): Talk by Liz Rice. this's quite detailed compared to the previous one.
6. [What is eBPF and How does it work](https://goteleport.com/blog/what-is-ebpf/): I found this more comprehensive and shortly covering many aspects.
7. [eBPF Internals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5Z2AU7QTH4&t=1209s): It's quiet advanced or I should say beyond the eBPF infrustructure.
