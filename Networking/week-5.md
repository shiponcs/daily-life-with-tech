Week-5; Connecting to the internet

### Dial-up connection

A dial-up connection uses POTS(Plain Old Telephone Service) for data transfer, and gets its name because the connection is established by actually dialing a phone number.

### Modem

Transferring Data across a dial-up connection is done through Model(Modulator/Demodulator).  They take data that computers can understand and turn them into audible wavelengths that can be transmitted over POTS. After all, the telephone system was developed to transmit voice messages or sounds from one place to another. This is conceptually similar to how line coding is used to turn ones and zeroes into modulating electrical charges across Ethernet cables.

### Baud rate

 A measurement of how many bits can be passed across a phone line in a second.

# Broadband

In the sense of Internet, broadband means any connectivity that isn't dial-up internet. 	



### T-carrier Technologies



### Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL)

#### DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer)



### Fiber Cable

**FTTX** Fiber to the X. X can be one the many things.

**FTTN**: Fiber to the neighbourhood

**FTTb**: fiber to the building

**FTTH**: fiber t the home

FTTP and FTTH together -> FTTP : fiber to the premises



### WAN- Wide Area Network

Acts like a single network, but spans across multiple physical locations. 

### Wireless technology

#### Frequency band

A certain section of the radio spectrum that's been agreed to be used for certain communications. The most common frequency band for wifi is 2.4GHz or 5GHz.

In 5 layer network model 802.11 can be mapped to physical and data link layer.

### Security

**WEP, Wired Equivalent Privacy**

An encryption technology that provides a very low level of privacy.  40 bit long key.

**WPA, WiFi Protected Access**

128 bit long key

  **WP2** 256 bit

**MAC filtering**
